I actually did this project last week for another company (they are still evaulating) but I tried to remove as much 
identifying information as I could as to not ruin their test by having it found on Google, etc.  This is a dating app
that flips images and would in an API implementation help match people up.   It doesn't take into account non-binary
and other situations; they kept it M/F "Tinder-like" (their words) for simplicity.   The test harness programs work
and mock data is loaded into an IEnumerable<PersonProfile> for storage later in a datastore.
